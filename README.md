# sbltex – A bundle of LaTeX styles for Society of Biblical Literature style documents

The `sbltex` bundle provides a set of LaTeX packages for typesetting documents
in line with the requirements of the Society of Biblical Literature. The
bundle includes class files for producing papers (`sblarticle`), theses
(`sblreport`), and books (`sblbook`). Bible references are supported using the
`bibleref-sbl` package and indices are supported using the `sblidx` package.
Bibliographic references are supported using the `biblatex-sbl` package which
is distributed separately.

## Installation from TeXLive or MiKTeX

The `sbltex` bundle is in TeXLive and MiKTeX and can be installed in the
usual way through your distribution. E.g., in TeXLive by running:

```
tlmgr install sbltex
```

## Installation from Git Source

`sbltex` uses the `l3build` system.

Clone the git repository using:

```
git clone https://github.com/dcpurton/sbltex.git
```

Change to the `sbltex` directory, and then the style files and documentation
can be installed by running:

```
l3build install --full
```
